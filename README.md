## A Unity2D Scroller game

> _The name started as a joke but I'm rolling with it_

My game will be a 2D left-to-right sideways scroller with platforms and if a player falls, they die. The objective of the game is for the player to escape/blast their way out of the vault before the computer system tracks the player and disintegrates them. The player also needs to break boxes/crates with their hands or weapons to build better weapons/laser cannons.
